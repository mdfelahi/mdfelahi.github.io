            <p>We invite you to contribute to the <a href="https://mdfelahi.github.io/ivw2024/">Workshop on Trust Calibration and Feedback Generation in AI-Enabled
            Vehicle Systems</a> as part of the 35<sup>th</sup> <a href="https://ieee-iv.org/2024/">IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium.</a></p>

            <h4>About the workshop:</h4>
            <p>Trust in AI is a prominent concern within human-AI interaction, particularly in the realm of automated vehicles (AV).
            Establishing and maintaining an appropriate level of trust in AI-enabled vehicle systems is crucial for the widespread
            acceptance and safe utilization of automated cars. Consequently, there is a need to calibrate user trust to align with
            the true capabilities of AI. Various factors influence trust, and diverse theories and applications for calibrating
            trust in AV are flourishing across different research communities. The most efficient and effective method for enhancing
            transparency in AV decision-making and fostering an appropriate level of trust is through feedback. Recently,
            significant attention has been devoted to relevant research in AV feedback design. This encompasses considerations such
            as feedback modality, interface design, feedback contents, feedback timing, and the underlying psychological and
            behavioral theories.</p>

            <p>
                Hosted by the IEEE ITSS Technical Committee on Human-Centered AI in Transportation (HAIT), the workshop aims to bring
                together researchers from a wide range of research communities, such as intelligent transportation systems, psychology,
                human factors, computer science/AI, and robotics/human-robot interaction. The goal is to facilitate discussions on
                recent research progress and future requirements in the domain of trust in AV.
