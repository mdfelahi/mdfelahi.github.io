        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>With the fast progress in AI algorithms and their implementations in the automated vehicle (AV) area, highly
            automated
            cars become more mature and closer to people’s daily lives. At the same time, public attitude towards and
            acceptance of
            the new technologies play an essential role in their implementation. Trust in AI is a widely known issue in
            human-AI
            interaction, and in automated driving, maintaining appropriate level of trust in the AI-enabled vehicle
            system is the
            key for the acceptance and safe use of automated cars. Either over-trust or under-trust is undesirable as
            they may lead
            to misuse or disuse of the system. As a result, trust needs to be calibrated, which refers to the
            requirement that the
            human’s trust in the AI should match the AI’s true capabilities. Many factors can affect trust, and the
            theories and
            applications to calibrate trust in AV are prosperous in different research communities, such as intelligent
            transportation systems, psychology, human factors, computer science/AI, robotics/human-robot interaction,
            just to name a
            few.</p>
        <p>
            Feedback is the most efficient and effective method to increase AV decision making transparency and
            facilitates the
            construction of an appropriate level of trust. Relevant research in feedback design, considering the
            feedback modality,
            interface design, feedback contents, feedback timing, and underneath psychological and behavioural theories,
            has drawn
            significant attention in recent years. As one on-going research area, many new theories and results are
            being actively
            proposed.
        </p>
        <p>
            A successful solution to the trust in AV issue requires interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers
            from various
            domains. This workshop tries to bring together the researchers from Human Factors and Ergonomics Society
            (HFES),
            American Psychological Association (APA), and the Special Interest Group on Computer–Human Interaction in
            the
            Association for Computing Machinery (ACM SIGCHI) with the IEEE Intelligent Transportation System society on
            the key
            issues of trust calibration and feedback development of human-centered automated driving systems. We also
            aim to foster
            collaborations and mentorship relationships that last beyond the workshop.
